            <h1>Incomprehensibility or readability? That is the question</h1>
            <p>The question is how I feel when they see me differently as a muslim. they never care, they never did. All they know is to hurt anothers sentiment and be a racist but try their best to act as if they are not the one. they always discriminate still like to pretend that they are so polite and sensible. It doesn't feel bad when they openly be a racist and pass jokes on whole muslim community. But it hurts when they pretend they don't did it intentionally or comes and fake apologises to you. No one wants your apology. Just show your real face. i'll appreciate it more. you don't have to apologies to me for your mentality. It's about you. It's not about me Beacause I don,t ever give a flying fuck about what you think about me or my community. But I'd really like to see your real self. Not that you come up after covering your real intention and true colors.</p>

            <h1>The usefulness of nonsensical content</h1>
            <p>The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the layout.</p>
